# Task Tamer â€“ Debug Challenge

You are given a small React app "Task Tamer" that lists tasks from a fake API and lets users add tasks. The project intentionally contains multiple bugs (render, state, async, a11y, and tests). Your goal is to make the app behave correctly and make the test suite pass. Do not add new dependencies unless necessary.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

You can run the app locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The failing tests should guide your fixes. Feel free to add more tests once the existing suite passes.
